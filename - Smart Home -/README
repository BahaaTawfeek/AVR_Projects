developing a system to Control 4 rooms, TV, and air conditioning (AC) by using 2 AVR Atmega32. it has 2 modes 
admin mode and guest mode -each one has password protected- Admin has more privilege which can control TV and AC but guest can 
control the rooms only. If you enter password wrong multiple time you enter a block mode where you must wait
a few seconds (20 Sec) then try again, this state is saved in the non-volatile memory (EEPROM) so restarting the system 
will not allow you to bypass this step. admin can set the temperature of the air conditioner which switches
on and off according to comparing target and ambient temperatures using a temp sensor. 
Drivers:DIO,EEPROM,KEYPAD,LCD,ADC,Timer,SPI,LM35 Sensor
Microcontroller:ATmega32
